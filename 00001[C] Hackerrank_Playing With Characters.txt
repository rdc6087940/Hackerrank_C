/*
This challenge will help you to learn how to take a character, a string and a sentence as input in C.

To take a single character  as input, you can use scanf("%c", &ch ); and printf("%c", ch) writes a character specified by the argument char to stdout

char ch;
scanf("%c", &ch);
printf("%c", ch);
This piece of code prints the character .

You can take a string as input in C using scanf(“%s”, s). But, it accepts string only until it finds the first space.

In order to take a line as input, you can use scanf("%[^\n]%*c", s); where  is defined as char s[MAX_LEN] where  is the maximum size of
 . Here, [] is the scanset character
. ^\n stands for taking input until a newline isn't encountered.
 Then, with this %*c, it reads the newline character and here, the used * indicates that this newline character is discarded.

-- Answer : 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() 
{
    char ch;
    scanf("%c", &ch);
    printf("%c\n", ch);
    
    char s[100];
    scanf("%s", s);
    printf("%s\n", s);
    
    char sen[100];
    scanf("\n");
    scanf("%[^\n]%*c", sen);
    printf("%s", sen);
   
    
    /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT */    
    return 0;
